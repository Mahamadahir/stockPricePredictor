# Stock Predictor Skeleton

This package provides the scaffolding for a production-grade stock price prediction system. The implementation now emphasizes modular data ingestion, feature engineering, model management, and serving flows that can be filled in iteratively.

## Architecture Overview

- **Configuration** (`src/stock_predictor/config`): centralizes runtime settings and environment loading.
- **Data** (`src/stock_predictor/data`): adapters for upstream sources, validation rules, and ingestion pipelines.
- **Features** (`src/stock_predictor/features`): transforms raw signals into model-ready feature matrices.
- **Models** (`src/stock_predictor/models`): training, registry management, and inference helpers.
- **Pipelines** (`src/stock_predictor/pipelines`): orchestration logic for end-to-end training and inference runs.
- **Evaluation** (`src/stock_predictor/evaluation`): forecast metrics and backtesting utilities.
- **API & UI** (`src/stock_predictor/api`, `src/stock_predictor/ui`): serving layer and stakeholder-facing interfaces.
- **Jobs** (`src/stock_predictor/jobs`): scheduled tasks for automated ingestion, retraining, and monitoring.
- **Utilities** (`src/stock_predictor/utils`): shared helpers for IO and logging.

All modules currently expose documented method stubs. These must be implemented to move from planning to execution.

## Implementation Guide

1. **Configure Settings**  
   - Fill in `stock_predictor.config.settings.load_settings` with environment-aware logic.

2. **Ingest & Validate Data**  
   - Implement the Yahoo Finance adapter and persistence methods.  
   - Wire up the ingestion and validation pipelines.

3. **Engineer Features**  
   - Complete the technical and fundamental feature builders, plus selection routines.

4. **Train Models**  
   - Implement the `ModelTrainer` workflow, integrate `ModelRegistry`, and add backtesting.

5. **Serve Predictions**  
   - Flesh out the inference service, API routes, CLI entrypoint, and FastAPI server bootstrap.

6. **Operationalize**  
   - Schedule jobs, connect logging, add dashboards, and expand tests beneath `tests/`.

## Development Setup

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

As modules are completed, add corresponding unit and integration tests under `tests/` to keep regression coverage high.
